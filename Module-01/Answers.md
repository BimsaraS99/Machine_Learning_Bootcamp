1. What is the key difference between traditional programming and machine learning?
Traditional Programming: You provide rules (logic) and data, and the computer gives the output.
Machine Learning: You provide data and the desired output (labels), and the computer learns the rules (model) by itself.

2. Give two real-world examples of how machine learning is used in everyday life.
Email Spam Filtering: Automatically detects and moves spam emails to the junk folder.
Voice Assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa): Understand and respond to voice commands using speech recognition models.

3. Explain in your own words what supervised learning is.
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, meaning the input data is paired with the correct output. The model learns to map inputs to outputs so it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

4. What kind of problems would be better suited to unsupervised learning?
Problems where the data isn’t labeled or categorized, such as:
Customer segmentation in marketing
Anomaly detection in cybersecurity or manufacturing
Grouping similar documents or products

5. How does reinforcement learning differ from supervised learning?
Supervised Learning: Learns from labeled examples (known input-output pairs).
Reinforcement Learning: Learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties, and improving its decisions over time.

6. What is the role of data in machine learning? Why is it important?
Data is the foundation of machine learning. It’s used to train models, validate performance, and make predictions. Without good, relevant data, a machine learning model can’t learn meaningful patterns or produce reliable results.

7. In the code snippet, what is the purpose of fit() in the ML model?
The fit() function trains the model using the provided training data and labels. It adjusts the internal parameters of the model to best match the input data to the expected output.

8. What does the predict() function do in a machine learning model?
The predict() function uses the trained model to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen input data.

9. What are some benefits of using machine learning over rule-based systems?
    Scalability: Learns from large, complex datasets.
    Adaptability: Improves over time as more data is added.
    Handles complexity: Finds patterns that are too difficult to hard-code manually.

10. Why is it important to evaluate machine learning models after training them?
Evaluation ensures the model performs well on new data and hasn’t just memorized the training set (overfitting). It helps determine accuracy, reliability, and generalization ability.
