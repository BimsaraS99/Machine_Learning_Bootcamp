1. What are the two primary components of a dataset used in supervised machine learning?

- **Features (Inputs)**:
   These are the variables or attributes used by the model to make predictions. Each feature represents a measurable property of the data.

   * Example: In a housing price prediction dataset, features might include number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc.

- **Targets (Labels / Outputs)**:
   These are the values the model is trying to predict or classify. The label is what the model learns to associate with the features during training.

   * Example: In the same housing dataset, the label would be the house price.

ðŸ§  For unsupervised learning, labels might not be presentâ€”only features are used to find patterns or clusters.
