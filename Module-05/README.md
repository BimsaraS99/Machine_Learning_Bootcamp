# Tutorial: Building a Binary Image Classifier with SVM and Decision Trees

## Introduction

Image classification is a fundamental problem in machine learning, where the goal is to assign labels to images based on their visual content. In this tutorial, we explore how to build a binary image classifier that distinguishes between two classes of grayscale images. We focus on using two classical machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Trees.

While deep learning methods are popular for image tasks, traditional algorithms like SVM and Decision Trees remain effective for smaller, simpler datasets or when computational resources are limited.

## Step 1: Understanding the Dataset and Preprocessing

Before training any model, it's crucial to understand and prepare your dataset. For image classification using traditional algorithms, raw images need to be converted into a format that these algorithms can process.

* **Grayscale Images**: Images are simplified to grayscale to reduce complexity. This means each pixel value ranges from 0 (black) to 255 (white).

* **Uniform Size**: All images must be resized to a consistent size (e.g., 100×100 pixels) so that each input has the same number of features.

* **Flattening Images**: Traditional ML algorithms expect data as vectors (1D arrays), not 2D images. Flattening means converting the 2D pixel matrix into a single vector by laying out rows or columns end-to-end. For a 100×100 image, flattening results in a feature vector of length 10,000.

## Step 2: Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets

To evaluate how well your model generalizes to unseen data, the dataset is split into two parts:

* **Training Set**: Used to train the model by learning the relationship between features (pixel values) and labels (classes).

* **Testing Set**: Used to evaluate the trained model’s performance on new, unseen images.

A common split ratio is 80% training and 20% testing, but this can vary based on dataset size.

## Step 3: Training the Classifiers

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)

SVM is a powerful algorithm designed to find the best boundary (hyperplane) that separates data points from two classes with the largest margin. In the context of image classification:

* Each image vector is treated as a point in a high-dimensional space.

* SVM attempts to find the line or plane that best divides the two classes with the widest gap.

* It works well for linearly separable data but can also handle non-linear cases using kernel functions.

SVMs are robust and often provide high accuracy, especially when the data is well-preprocessed.

### Decision Trees

Decision Trees classify data by learning a series of decision rules inferred from the features:

* Starting at the root, the tree asks yes/no questions about pixel values (e.g., “Is pixel 345 > 128?”).

* Based on answers, the data splits down different branches, leading to leaves that represent predicted classes.

Decision Trees are intuitive and easy to interpret but can overfit if not properly controlled.

## Step 4: Evaluating Model Performance

After training, the model's predictions on the test set are compared with the actual labels using metrics such as:

* **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified images.

* **Classification Report**: Includes precision, recall, and F1-score to provide detailed insight into model performance, especially if classes are imbalanced.

Visualizing predictions and errors helps identify patterns and potential improvements.

## Step 5: Making Predictions on New Images

To classify a new image:

1. The image is preprocessed the same way as the training images (grayscale, resized, flattened).

2. The processed image vector is passed to the trained model.

3. The model outputs the predicted class label (e.g., “square” or “circle”).

Displaying the image alongside the predicted label helps verify if the prediction makes sense visually.

## Practical Tips

* **Feature Scaling**: While not always necessary for Decision Trees, scaling pixel values (e.g., normalizing between 0 and 1) can improve SVM performance.

* **Avoiding Overfitting**: Decision Trees can memorize training data; techniques like pruning or setting maximum depth help generalize better.

* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust parameters such as kernel type for SVM or tree depth for Decision Trees to optimize accuracy.

* **Dataset Quality**: Clear, consistent images with well-defined classes make learning easier for both algorithms.

## Conclusion

Building a binary image classifier with classical machine learning algorithms like SVM and Decision Trees involves:

* Preprocessing images into flat vectors.

* Training models on labeled data.

* Evaluating performance on unseen images.

This process offers an approachable introduction to image classification without needing deep learning complexity, making it ideal for educational purposes, small projects, or when computational resources are limited.
